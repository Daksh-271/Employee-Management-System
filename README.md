# Employee-Management-System
 The "<b style="font-size:16px;">Employee Management System"<b> is a web-based application designed to help managers  efficiently manage employee records through a structured workflow that implements CRUD  (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. Managers can register and log in to a personalized  dashboard, where they can view, add, edit, and delete employee records. <hr>
The application is built using core web technologies, including HTML and CSS for the user interface, while Java Servlets handle the backend logic. Hibernate ORM is utilized for object relational mapping, ensuring smooth interactions between Java objects and the database, and the Spring Framework is integrated for dependency injection and improved maintainability.
